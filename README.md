# The image database

## A step by step series to join TID!

# Prerequisites
You will need to have Node.js on your machine and this document will assume that you have yarn (npm should be ok too). To install yarn do:
npm install -g yarn
you will also need to have jest (https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started). To install it just run the yarn command in the terminal in your project directory with no arguments like so:

```
yarn
```


## How to contribute to the image database

First you have to clone or download the BackEnd repository. Then you open the project in your code editor go to:
/Fimmdropar/BackEnd/therealbackend, in your terminal. Once you are there write:

```
node index.js
```

The terminal should say "Example app listening on port 3000!" - Now you have started the backend server

Open index.html in /Fimmdropar/BackEnd/ ,sign up and start adding to the growing database of pictures!

## Exploring the database (the front end)
To access the front end of the database you have to clone or download the FrontEnd repository. Once you have done that open index.html in your 
browser and start surfing through the incredibly wast ocean of pictures!




## Troubleshooting
If theRealBackend is not replying "Example app listening on port 3000!" try writing yarn in to the terminal and try again.
